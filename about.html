    <h1> Mr. Spicer's Biography </h1>

    <h2>Hello everyone!</h2>
    <p> 
    My name is Russell Spicer and I love playing music, building things/home 
    renovations, baseball, math, hiking with my family, and learning about new technology. 
    I am happily married to my lovely wife, Jennifer, and we have two children. 
    Our daughter's name is Stella and our son's name is Dean. 
    Right now, my kids are really into Super Mario Bros. and we have been playing 
    a <b>LOT</b> of Mario Kart.

<h3> What am I up to now? </h3>
<p>
I am currently getting my EdS in Instructional Technology and I genuinely enjoy learning
about new technology and helping others(student/teachers) use technology.  
Right now I teach <em>Algebra</em> at <strong>Habersham Ninth Grade Academy</strong>. 
However, I have taught AP Statistics, Algebra 2, Geometry, Foundations of Algebra, 
Pre Calculus, and Math of Finance in the past. 
I love to use 3D modeling before I start a renovation in my home, and I 
have also used it to help demonstrate mathematical concepts to my students.
I went ahead and included a 
<a href="http://spicermath.weebly.com/" target="_blank">website</a> 
that I built using weebly before I had any 
knowledge of html. This is the website I use with my students each year.
