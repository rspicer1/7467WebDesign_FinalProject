<h1> Mr. Spicer's Biography </h1>

<h2>Hello everyone!</h2>
<p> 
My name is Russell Spicer and I love playing music, building things/home <br>
renovations, baseball, math, hiking with my family, and learning about new technology. <br>
I am happily married to my lovely wife, Jennifer, and we have two children. <br>
Our daughter's name is Stella and our son's name is Dean. <br>
Right now, my kids are really into Super Mario Bros. and we have been playing <br>
a <b>LOT</b> of Mario Kart.

<h3> What am I up to now? </h3>
<p>
I am currently getting my EdS in Instructional Technology and I genuinely enjoy learning <br>
about new technology and helping others(student/teachers) use technology.  <br>
Right now I teach <em>Algebra</em> at <strong>Habersham Ninth Grade Academy</strong>. <br>
However, I have taught AP Statistics, Algebra 2, Geometry, Foundations of Algebra, <br>
Pre Calculus, and Math of Finance in the past. <br>
I love to use 3D modeling before I start a renovation in my home, and I <br>
have also used it to help demonstrate mathematical concepts to my students. <br>
I went ahead and included a 
<a href="http://spicermath.weebly.com/" target="_blank">website</a> 
that I built using weebly before I had any <br>
knowledge of html. This is the website I use with my students each year. <br>
